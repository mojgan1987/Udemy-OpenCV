# weighted average
# points move to center of centroid
# when points stopped moveing, we are at the center
# not always the best clusters

# calculate the color histogram of the target aeaand keep sliding the tracking window to the closest match
# if the target gets a way or moves toward the camera, mean shift does not work -> CAM (continousy adapted meanshift)
